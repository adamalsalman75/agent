# AI Task Assistant System

A sophisticated task management system built with AI-driven interactions, implementing advanced agent patterns for intelligent task refinement and management.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` - Spring Boot backend with AI agent implementation
- `frontend/` - React frontend for interactive task management (coming soon)

## Architecture Overview

This project implements several core patterns of AI agent architecture:

### 1. Tasks Pattern
Tasks are discrete units of work that the agent can perform. Each task is self-contained and has a specific responsibility.

### 2. Knowledge Pattern
Knowledge represents the agent's memory and information storage, allowing it to learn from experience and maintain state.

### 3. Sensor Pattern
Sensors gather information from the environment, providing the agent with context about its world.

### 4. Decision Making Pattern
The decision-making pattern determines what actions to take based on sensor input and knowledge.

### 5. Chain of Thought Pattern
Chain of Thought represents the AI's internal reasoning process, breaking down complex problems into discrete steps.

### 6. Refinement Pattern
Refinement represents the iterative improvement process through user feedback and validation.

## How the Patterns Work Together

1. **Information Gathering**: Sensors collect data from the environment
2. **Context Building**: Knowledge base provides historical context and patterns
3. **Decision Process**: Decision maker evaluates situations using collected data
4. **Action Execution**: Selected tasks are executed based on decisions
5. **Learning**: Results are stored back in the knowledge base

See individual README files in backend/ and frontend/ directories for specific setup and running instructions.
