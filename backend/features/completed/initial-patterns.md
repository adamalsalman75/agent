# Initial AI Agent Patterns Implementation

## Metadata
- Status: Completed
- Completion Date: 2025-03-26
- Dependencies: 
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring AI
  - OpenAI integration
- Technical Lead: TBD

## Overview
Implemented the foundational patterns for the AI agent architecture, focusing on Decision Making and Tasks patterns, with interfaces defined for additional patterns.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Decision Making Pattern
- Implemented `DecisionMaker` interface
- Created `OpenAIDecisionMaker` concrete implementation
- Added `ActionDecision` record for passing decisions
- Integrated with Spring AI's ChatClient
- Basic intent classification working

### 2. Task Pattern
- Implemented `TaskAction` interface
- Created concrete implementations:
  - `CreateTaskAction`
  - `CompleteTaskAction`
  - `ListTasksAction`
- Task persistence with Spring Data JDBC
- Basic task model with key fields

### 3. Interface Definitions
Created interfaces for future patterns:
- `KnowledgeBase` for state management
- `Refinement` for iterative improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
1. Decision Making:
```java
public interface DecisionMaker {
    Optional<ActionDecision> decide(Map<String, Object> context);
}
```

2. Task Actions:
```java
public interface TaskAction {
    Map<String, Object> execute(Map<String, Object> context);
    boolean canHandle(String intent);
}
```

3. Basic Task Model:
```java
public record Task(
    Long id,
    String description,
    boolean completed,
    LocalDateTime createdAt,
    LocalDateTime completedAt
) { }
```

## Current Capabilities
- Natural language processing of basic task commands
- Task creation with descriptions
- Task completion tracking
- Task listing and status management
- Basic persistence layer
- REST API endpoints for task management

## Lessons Learned
1. Pattern separation provides clean architecture
2. Spring AI integration works well for basic NLP
3. Record classes provide clean immutable data structures
4. Interface-first approach supports future extensibility

## Future Enhancements
The groundwork is laid for:
- Implementing the Refinement pattern
- Implementing knowledge persistence
