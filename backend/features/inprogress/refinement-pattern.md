# Refinement Pattern Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- Status: In Progress
- Priority: High
- Start Date: 2025-03-26
- Dependencies: 
  - Existing Task model
  - OpenAI integration
- Technical Lead: TBD

## Overview
Transform the task management system from simple command parsing to intelligent task refinement through iterative LLM interactions.

## Current State
The system currently uses the LLM just for intent classification:
- CREATE_TASK|description
- COMPLETE_TASK|id
- LIST_TASKS

## Proposed Enhancement
Implement multi-turn conversations to refine and improve task details through user interaction.

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Complex Task Breakdown
```
User: "Create a task for the conference"
AI: "I notice this is a complex task. Let me ask some clarifying questions:
     - Is this for organizing or attending a conference?
     - When is the conference?
     - What are the main objectives?"
User: "It's for organizing our tech conference in June"
AI: "Thanks. Would you like me to break this down into subtasks? I'm thinking:
     - Venue selection
     - Speaker invitations
     - Schedule planning
     - Marketing materials"
User: "Yes, but add budget planning too"
AI: *creates the main task with these subtasks, properly structured and linked*
```

### 2. Task Enhancement
```
User: "Create a task to buy groceries"
AI: "To make this task more actionable, could you specify:
     - Any dietary restrictions?
     - Approximate budget?
     - When do you need these by?"
User: "Vegetarian meals, $100, needed by tomorrow"
AI: *creates detailed task with constraints and deadline*
```

### 3. Learning Goals Refinement
```
User: "Create a task to learn Spring AI"
AI: "Let me help structure this learning task:
     - What's your current experience with Spring?
     - Are there specific features you want to focus on?
     - Do you have a target completion date?"
User: "Intermediate with Spring Boot, want to focus on chat completions"
AI: *creates structured learning plan with milestones*
```

## Required Changes

1. Data Model Updates
- Add support for task metadata (deadlines, priorities, constraints)
- Implement subtask relationships
- Store conversation context

2. API Changes
- Add endpoint for conversation continuation
- Support for multi-turn interactions
- Task relationship management

3. Service Layer Updates
- Implement stateful conversation handling
- Add task decomposition logic
- Enhance prompt engineering for better interaction

4. UI/API Considerations
- How to handle async nature of conversations
- Maintaining conversation state
- Clear indication of AI thinking/processing

## Value Addition
- More actionable and well-defined tasks
- Better task organization through decomposition
- Improved user experience through guided task creation
- Richer task metadata for better management
- Intelligent assistance in task planning
